# galaxyDefenders

This is a street fighter style fighting game made by me (Tyler Westerberg), Paul Zaranski, Tristan Ecker, and Zachary DiGidio.

This game was made in 3 weeks for my AP Computer Science A final project, which entailed a competition between 4 teams to make the best game in java with no game engine. 
This game won first prize, after being voted on by all of the students in my highschool who playtested all the games.
